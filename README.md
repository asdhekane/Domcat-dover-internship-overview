## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive portfolio overview of the full-stack web application I architected and developed during my software engineering internship at Dover India Innovation Center. As the sole developer, I had end-to-end ownership of the project, from initial concept to final deployment. The application was designed to automate the manual process of categorizing website domains, resulting in a significant increase in efficiency and accuracy.

***Note:*** *The source code for this project is proprietary to Dover India and cannot be shared publicly.*

## The Problem Statement

The existing process for categorizing company website domains was entirely manual, consuming significant employee hours and leading to potential inconsistencies. This manual effort created a bottleneck, diverting skilled personnel from higher-value strategic tasks. The goal was to develop an automated solution that would drastically reduce manual labor, improve accuracy, and free up employee time.

## My Role: End-to-End Ownership

As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for the entire lifecycle, from the initial concept to the final deployment. My key contributions included:

* **Conceptualization:** Proposed and designed the automation solution after identifying critical inefficiencies in the existing manual categorization workflow.
* **System Design:** Collaborated with management to define project requirements and architect the full tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB).
* **Full-Stack Development:** Engineered the complete application, including the interactive front-end, the RESTful API backend, and the database schema.
* **Security:** Implemented secure user authentication using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) tailored for internal company access.
* **Deployment:** Managed the complete deployment process onto an on-premise Windows VM with NGINX, ensuring a stable and high-performance application.

## Key Features & Achievements

* **Drastic Efficiency Gains:** The core automation feature reduced the manual effort required for domain categorization by over 90%, freeing up significant employee time for more critical tasks.
* **Intelligent Classification:** Implemented a BERT-based NLP engine for accurate, intelligent domain categorization, which improved the classification precision by more than 50% over previous methods.
* **Secure & Modern Frontend:** Developed a user-friendly interface with React that featured secure, internal authentication handled by Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
* **High-Performance Deployment:** The application was deployed using NGINX as a reverse proxy, ensuring high performance and reliable web serving in a production environment.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Authentication:** Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), Platform Identity Management (IdM)
* **Deployment:** NGINX, Docker
* **Development:** Git, Agile/Scrum
